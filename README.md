# Diabetes_Care_Quality_Assessment
Research goal: The phenomenon of patients being rehospitalized shortly after their initial discharge, particularly in cases of diabetes, has significant implications for healthcare quality and cost management. This issue has prompted initiatives like those from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, who seek to mitigate healthcare expenses and enhance care quality by penalizing hospitals with unexpectedly high readmission rates for certain medical conditions. Despite diabetes not being a current focus for these penalties, its financial burden is notable; in 2011, the cost attributed to the readmission of diabetic patients within a 30-day period post-discharge was over $41 billion in the U.S. Understanding the factors that contribute to these readmissions is crucial for reducing costs and improving patient outcomes. Our analysis, leveraging a dataset of medical claims, aims to uncover:
1. The primary factors that influence the likelihood of diabetic patients being readmitted to the hospital.
2. The potential for accurately forecasting such readmissions in diabetic cases based on a dataset with a limited range of features.
